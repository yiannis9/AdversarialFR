# AdversarialFR
Msc Thesis - Adversarial Attacks on Face Recognition systems using Deepfool variants.

## Dataset
The dataset used was a customised subset of the VGGFace2 dataset. The repository holds numpy-packaged sets of the dataset to save time.

## Models
We trained three models for this project using transfer learning with their architectures listed below:
> Xception
> 
> Inception v3
> 
> EfficientNet-B0

## Adversarial Attacks
We will demonstrate the original DeepFool attack on facial recognition systems as well as 2 new variants.
Attacks included are:
> Deepfool
> 
> Spiked Deepfool
> 
> Quadruple Gradient Acceleration
> 
## Evaluation
Please refer to the main Thesis document for the evaluation.
