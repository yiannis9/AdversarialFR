# AdversarialFR
Msc Thesis on digital adversarial Attacks on Face Recognition systems.
## Use of VGG pretrained model
Unfortunately both FaceNet and Deepface( which uses parts of the former) show version incompatibilities with most up to date AI and ML libraries, hence we will not be using their libraries directly.
Instead we will use Tensorflow 2.X.X and OpenCV among others to load a pretrained VGGFACE2 model to perform the attacks.
## Adversarial Attacks
We will demonstrate some pre existing adversarial attacks on facial recognition systems as well as a new one.
Attacks included are:
> One pixel Attack
> Deepfool
> Noise Attack
## Evaluation
**TBD**
using multiple datasets (eg. VGG, CelebA, LFW, etc)
